# 🎬 Sentiment Analysis for Movie Reviews

## 📋 Project Overview
This project implements an NLP pipeline to classify sentiment in cinematic reviews. It leverages **spaCy** for linguistic preprocessing and **Scikit-Learn** for statistical modeling.

## 🧪 Methodology & Logic
* [cite_start]**Linguistic Preprocessing:** Used `spaCy` for lemmatization rather than simple stemming to preserve semantic meaning.
* [cite_start]**Feature Engineering:** Implemented **TF-IDF with Bigrams** to capture context and handle negations (e.g., "not good").
* **Model:** Multinomial Naive Bayes, optimized for high-dimensional text data.

## 📊 Performance Analysis
| Metric | Score |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Accuracy** | 88% |
| **Precision (Neg)** | 0.89 |
| **Recall (Pos)** | 0.87 |



## 🚀 Deployment
[cite_start]Fully containerized using **Docker** to ensure environment parity between development and production.
